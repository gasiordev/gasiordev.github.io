Few days ago I had a look at one of my old packages in Go for creating a CLI
application. It was out of date and lacking some functionality so I have
tweaked it a bit. Hence, this small post about it.

Basically, in Go you can use [flag](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/) package to
parse command line arguments (including flags). It's simple to use. However,
I needed a package where I could define whole CLI interface with commands,
flags, arguments, attach certain functions to it and have better validation.

There are many great CLI packages there on the Internet. See
[Awesome Go](https://awesome-go.com/#command-line) for some of them. But
still, I coded something that fits my purpose a bit more.

### Code

`go-cli` library can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gasiordev/go-cli).

Check sample code below:

```
myCLI      := cli.NewCLI("Example CLI", "Silly app", "Author <a@example.com>")

cmdInit    := myCLI.AddCmd("init", "Initialises the project", InitHandler)
cmdStart   := myCLI.AddCmd("start", "Start the application", StartHandler)

cmdInit.AddFlag("template", "t", "filepath", "Path to template file", TypePathFile|MustExist|Required)
cmdInit.AddFlag("file-output", "o", "filepath", "Output to a specific file instead of stdout", TypePathFile)
cmdInit.AddFlag("number", "n", "int", "Number necessary for initialisation", TypeInt|Required)

cmdStart.AddFlag("username", "u", "username", "Username", TypeAlphanumeric|AllowDots|AllowUnderscore|Required)
cmdStart.AddFlag("threshold", "", "1.5", "Threshold, default 1.5", TypeFloat)
cmdStart.AddArg("input", "FILE", "Path to a file", TypePathFile|Required)
cmdStart.AddArg("difficulty", "DIFFICULTY", "Level of difficulty (1-5), default 3", TypeInt)

os.Exit(myCLI.Run(os.Stdout, os.Stderr))
```

In the below snippets, `InitHandler` and `StartHandler` are functions defined as follows:
```
func InitHandler(c *cli.CLI) int {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "Template path: %s\n", c.Flag("template"))
    return 0
}

func StartHandler(c *cli.CLI) int {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "Username: %s\n", c.Flag("username"))
    return 0
}
```
